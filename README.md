# MIT-6.0001-problemsets

I'm going to upload all the code to the problemsets for the course [MIT 6.0001 (Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) offered by MIT OCW here.

I have also created a [Daily Log](https://github.com/krushanbauva/MIT-6.0001-problemsets/issues/1) to keep a track on my progress.
